# Exams_Preperation
Random Questions generator for exam preperations

all files of both questions and answers should be in the same name 
eg: 

<assignment #> --> 1-1 <-- <question #> .jpg (or whatever image format)
== 1-1.jpg etc.
should install python in order to use the JS array creation tool - add paths manually.


inside the images folder there sould be a subfolder(s) named by the subject's name - with underscores!
in each subject folder there sould be 2 subfolders: 
--answers
--questions

each one should contain the SAME amount of files, and in THE SAME NAME (eg. 1-1.jpg)

take in mind to point the python script to the jsarr.js file inside images and than manually copy and paste it in the approperiate js file (with approperiate name) in the data sets folder.
keep in mind to add the js arr to "arrays" object inside the init function..... :P

good luck!
